# What is it ?
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

# Game 1: Simon Says

## 1-player Game
Slide the ON/OFF switch to ON, the Game Selector switch to "1" and the Skill Level switch to 1,2, 3 or 4.

Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
## 2 or More Player Game
Players may team up against Simon or compete with each other.

Decide who goes first.

Play proceeds as described above except players take turns repeating Simon's signals

# Game 2: Player Adds

## 1-player Game
Slide the ON/OFF switch to ON, the Game Selector switch to "2" and the Skill Level switch to "4".

Press the START button. Simon will give only the first signal.

Repeat Simon's signal, and imme- diately add one. In this game, don't wait for Simon to repeat signals!

Repeat the first two signals and add one more.

Continue repeating the signals of the previous sequence and increas- ing that sequence by one. Try to reach the longest sequence of 31!

If you make an error or take more than 5 seconds to play any signal, you'll hear the "RAZZ" sound. This means the game is over.

Press the LAST button, and count the number of signals as it plays back the last (longest) sequence. This is your score.

To play again, repeat Steps 2 through 7. If you make it to 31 signals, Simon will salute you with six short signals.

## 2 or More Player Game
Follow Steps 1 and 2 above.

Player 1 repeats the first signal and adds one.

Player 2 repeats the first two signals and adds one.

Play continues clockwise with each player repeating the signals of the previous sequence and adding one more.

Any player who makes an error or takes more than 5 seconds to play a signal is given the "RAZZ" sound and is out of the game. Press the START button to begin a new sequence with remaining players.

The last player left in the game wins!

# Game 3: Choose your Color
## 4-player Game
Slide the ON/OFF switch to ON, the Game Selector switch to "3" and the Skill Level switch to "4". The longest sequence possible is 31 signals.

Each player chooses one color lens and will press only that color lens in the game.

Press the START button. Simon will give the first signal.

The player who chose that color repeats the signal.

Play continues as described in Game 1, except that each player presses only his or her chosen color in the proper sequence.

If you press your color out of sequence or take more than 5 seconds to press, you'll hear the "RAZZ" sound and your color is out of the game.

Simon will automatically begin a new game with only the remaining colors.

## that's it for now, let's play the game nowðŸ˜€
